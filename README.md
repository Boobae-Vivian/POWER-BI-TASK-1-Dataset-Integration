- ### STEP 5 and 6

  Upon clicking on "Connect," a connection details page will emerge. In this stage, I navigated to the Downloads folder where the CSV Bank_Full dataset was situated, selected the dataset using its file name, and clicked on "Open." This action prompts POWER BI to establish a connection, leading to a page where data cleaning or transformation can be performed if necessary. However, for the purpose of this task, which exclusively centers on data import and excludes cleaning and transformation, we will proceed by selecting the "Load" option button.
